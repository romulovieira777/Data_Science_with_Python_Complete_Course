Udemy Review Update

A Special Note From 1stMentor & Team:

On the Udemy platform, shortly after you start a course, you will be asked to leave an initial rating. While this can feel quite early, since you haven’t gotten into too much course content yet, it is an important rating to understand your opinion on the course so far.

I hope when you see this question you can safely say that I’ve earned your initial five-star rating for the course.

But if it is simply too early to tell, you can always defer the rating until later.

Let’s get you back to your learning. I'll see you in the next lecture!
